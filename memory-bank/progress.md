# Project Progress

## Current Status
ðŸš€ Phase 1 Complete - Core Implementation

### Completed
- Memory bank structure created
- Project requirements documented
- Technical architecture planned
- Implementation phases defined
- Basic HTML/CSS structure with canvas
- Vector2D utility for movement calculations
- Element class hierarchy with SVG shapes
- Game class with core simulation logic
- Animation loop and physics implementation
- Element counters and winner overlay

### In Progress
- Testing and refinement of collision detection
- Movement path smoothness optimization
- Visual polish and effects

### To Do
#### Phase 2: Visual Enhancement
- Implement SVG morphing animations
- Add glow effects during collisions
- Enhance transformation animations
- Polish rotation effects

#### Phase 3: Optimization
- Implement spatial partitioning for collisions
- Add performance monitoring
- Optimize render loop
- Add frame rate controls

## Known Issues
- None reported yet - initial implementation just completed

## Next Actions
1. Test collision detection thoroughly
2. Refine movement patterns
3. Begin Phase 2 visual enhancements
4. Add performance monitoring
